# Hospital Patient Analytics 🏥📊

A comprehensive analytics platform for hospital admission data analysis, patient flow prediction, and resource planning.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital admission patterns to help healthcare facilities with:
- **Admission Rate Analysis**: Patterns by age groups and disease types
- **Busy Period Prediction**: Forecasting high-demand periods for resource planning
- **Regional Disease Mapping**: Common diseases by geographic regions
- **Resource Optimization**: Data-driven insights for hospital management

## 📊 Dataset Information

Our analysis is based on real hospital data including:
- **15,739+ admission records** with comprehensive patient information
- **361 mortality records** for outcome analysis
- **719 environmental pollution records** for correlation studies
- **57 medical conditions** and diagnostic parameters

### Key Data Features:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, location)
- Medical history and conditions
- Laboratory values and vital signs
- Treatment outcomes
- Environmental factors

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Data Analysis Modules
- Age-based admission pattern analysis
- Disease prevalence by demographics
- Seasonal and temporal trends
